# FreeCodeCamp-D3

D3.js is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of the widely implemented SVG, HTML5, and CSS standards.

This project utilizes D3 along with React to manipulate and display data from various sources.

The requirements for the projects within this repository come from the Free Code Camp Data Visualization Certification Data Visualization Projects.
